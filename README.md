## Why Supercharged Shadcn Components?

Modern frontend development demands speed, flexibility, and maintainability. **Supercharged Shadcn Component** bridges these needs by offering:

- **Pre-Designed Components**: Save time by using ready-to-use components inspired by **shadcn/ui**, **Material-UI**, and **timepicker** from **time.openstatus.dev**.
- **Simpler Forms**: Unlike the shadcn implementation of `react-hook-form`, this library provides a simpler, more type-safe solution that reduces boilerplate and streamlines form handling.
- **Utility-Focused**: Includes useful utilities to enhance your application's functionality.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Components seamlessly integrate with libraries like:
  - [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for date manipulation
  - [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations
  - [numeral](http://numeraljs.com/) for number formatting
  - [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for flexible and performant form handling

## Copy, Paste, and Go!

Supercharged Shadcn Component follows the philosophy of **code-first** simplicity. Just like **shadcn/ui**, you can:

1. **Copy** the component code.
2. **Paste** it directly into your project.
3. **Install dependencies** if needed.

It's that easy.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by multiple libraries and UI frameworks to bring together the best practices and designs. Whether you need modern Material Design aesthetics or robust time pickers, this library combines diverse sources to provide a cohesive developer experience.
